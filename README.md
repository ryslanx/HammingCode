# HammingCode
This program has 3 functions: encode,send and decode. After the encode, the function is encoded using Hamming code algorithm. The send function corresponds for creating unstable Internet connection. After the simulation of errors in every byte the decode function should determine the errors and decode the string properly so we will get the same string as in the beginning.
